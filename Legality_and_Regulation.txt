Legality and Regulation:
The legality and regulation of drugs and alcohol vary significantly from one country to 
another and even within different regions or states of a single country. These regulations 
are often influenced by cultural, social, economic, and historical factors. Below, I'll provide 
a general overview of how drugs and alcohol are typically regulated:

Alcohol:
    1.) Legal Drinking Age: Most places have a minimum legal drinking age to prevent underage 
    alcohol consumption.
    2.) Licensing and Taxation: Regulations govern alcohol production, sale, and taxation.
    3.) Advertising Rules: Strict advertising rules are often in place to prevent misleading
    marketing.
    4.) Prohibited Activities: Public intoxication and driving under the influence are illegal.

Drugs:
    1.) Controlled Substances: Drugs are classified based on abuse potential and medical value.
    2.) Prescription Requirement: Some drugs require a prescription for safe use.
    3.) Illegal Drugs: Many countries have strict laws against certain drugs.
    4.)Harm Reduction: Some regions emphasize harm reduction over criminalization.
    5.) Medical Marijuana: Legalization and regulation vary for medical and recreational marijuana.

It's important to note that drug and alcohol regulations are subject to change, and local laws 
may differ significantly. It's essential for individuals to be aware of and abide by the specific 
regulations in their area. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in legal consequences.

Efforts to regulate drugs and alcohol aim to strike a balance between public health, safety, and 
individual freedoms. These regulations are continually evolving as societies grapple with issues 
related to substance misuse and addiction.
