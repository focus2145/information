Drugs:

Definition: 
Drugs are chemical substances that can alter the functioning of the body or 
mind when introduced into the system. They can be classified into different categories 
based on their effects, such as stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and narcotics.

Types: 
There is a wide range of drugs, including prescription medications, over-the-
counter drugs, and illegal substances. Some common categories of drugs include 
painkillers, sedatives, antidepressants, and recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, 
and heroin.

Effects: The effects of drugs vary widely depending on the type of drug used. Some 
drugs can produce feelings of euphoria, increased energy, and heightened alertness 
(stimulants), while others may induce relaxation and sedation (depressants) or alter
perception and consciousness (hallucinogens).

Alcohol:

Definition: 
Alcohol refers to a class of organic compounds that includes ethanol, the 
type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, and spirits. Ethanol is the 
psychoactive substance responsible for the effects of alcohol consumption.

Types: 
Alcoholic beverages come in various forms, including beer, wine, whiskey, vodka, 
and more. These beverages differ in terms of alcohol content and flavor.
Effects: Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. When consumed, it can 
produce effects such as relaxation, reduced inhibitions, impaired coordination, and 
impaired judgment. In moderation, alcohol consumption may have some social and 
recreational benefits, but excessive or prolonged use can lead to addiction and various 
health issues, including liver damage, heart problems, and addiction.
